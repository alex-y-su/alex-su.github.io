          Prompt Engineering: A Competitive Edge As an employer and a leader who utilizes AI regularly, I have seen firsthand why prompt engineering is becoming a must-have skill.
Hiring for Initiative Candidates skilled at prompting immediately stand out in job interviews nowadays. With AI assistants handling lots of routine tasks, I’m looking for self-starters who can maximize productivity from day one. Prompt literacy demonstrates that - rather than needing detailed instructions, these employees take charge to translate goals into crisp prompts that extract the most value from AI.

          Embracing the Future: Why AI Is More Than Just a Hype Short version Quick and Smart Information Access:
AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), delivers fast and accurate search results. Understands user queries better than traditional search engines. Overcoming the Blank Page Syndrome:
AI suggests simple steps to start big tasks, making it easier to begin work. Acts as a helpful nudge against procrastination. Economical for Work:
AI is cost-effective, offering significant time savings for a fraction of the cost.

          One of the primary challenges confronting current AI models, especially the transformer-based ones, is the ability to ensure consistent results. While it’s a recognized fact that these models might produce different outputs for identical datasets, it’s crucial to differentiate between consistency and determinism. Determinism, in a computational context, means that given the same initial conditions, the algorithm will produce the same results every time. However, inherent randomness during training can introduce variability.

          As times goes by the lines between different business processes have started to blur. One such area where this is increasingly evident is the intersection of business processing systems and marketing.
The Overlap Between Business Processing Systems and Marketing It’s quite intuitive to view marketing processes as an extension of general business processes. While there are occasional exceptions, such as viral marketing phenomena, the majority of marketing work hours are spent following a fairly deterministic execution flow.

          Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can be incredibly helpful tools for generating text quickly and accurately. However, it’s important to remember that LLMs are not sentient beings and they don’t truly understand the meaning behind the language they generate. Instead, they use mathematical models to predict the most likely response based on their training data. To use LLMs effectively, it’s important to be mindful of the data that’s being used to train them.
