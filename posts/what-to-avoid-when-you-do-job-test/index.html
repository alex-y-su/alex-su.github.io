        <p>I&rsquo;ve been interviewing software developers for 11 years, and for the last four years, I&rsquo;ve averaged 1-2 interviews each
week. We normally don&rsquo;t send a test to persons whose experience we can readily validate in an interview or through a
background check, but it is OK to send a test to applicants with no or little experience. From start to finish, the test
usually takes less than 4 hours to construct. Normally, I evaluate test results personally, and here is a list of things
I dislike:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The test result was supplied as an attachment and compressed using a &rsquo;exotic&rsquo; archiver (.rar, .7z, .etc). Use
GitHub/Bitbucket instead; they are free and demonstrate that you are knowledgeable with Git. If you must send it as an
attachment, use zip. Source codes for a four-hour test should not be too large if you supply only what is required (
see next point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The repository contains editor folders/binaries/libraries. It demonstrates a lack of concern or understanding of what
you are doing. The goal of the exam is to see how well you can code, not to get a functional binary. Adding libraries
in source code typically indicates that you are taking your initial steps in technology (there may be exceptions) and
are unaware of the package management for the platform on which you work. Editor folders (.idea,.vscode) imply that
you do not check what you commit, which is a common problem among junior engineers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artifacts from the project template. There is nothing wrong with using the templates given by the IDE. Nevertheless,
the majority of the templates contain more files than are required to complete the exam. It might be configuration
files or an empty test template (see next point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percentage of candidates that develop any unit tests is nearly nil. Generally, I notice blank templates, which
indicates that the applicant does not read what he/she commits and does not share my enthusiasm for unit tests. Even
if you recognize that this project will not be supported after completed, unit tests always create a positive
impression on the reviewer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Style of coding. It is difficult to identify precise code indicators that indicate a newbie, yet it is always evident
if the candidate has experience or not. Naming conventions, parsing, serialization, and library selection all have an
impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
