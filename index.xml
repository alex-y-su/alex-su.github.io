      <description>Unleashing the Full Potential of AI: Crafting Code for Language Models In the ever-evolving technological realm, integrating language models into software development has emerged as a game-changer. However, maximizing the benefits of this AI-driven approach requires a strategic mindset and meticulous coding practices. By embracing modularity, emphasizing automated testing, limiting dependencies, and harnessing clear naming conventions, we can pave the way for a seamless collaboration between human developers and language models.</description>

      <description>The Dawn of Intuitive Technology: Reflecting on Jensen Huang&amp;rsquo;s Vision Summary:
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang envisions a future where AI and intuitive technology will transform programming so that &amp;ldquo;nobody has to program&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;everybody in the world is now a programmer.&amp;rdquo;
In the next 10-20 years, we may see a transition from current technological interfaces to AI-powered interfaces that understand users and produce solutions intuitively.
This will require a shift in the IT landscape towards thousands of specialized AI models rather than thousands of frameworks.</description>

      <description>Beyond ChatGPT: OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Rumored Foray into Advanced Browser Agents Introduction to Agents 2.0 Recent rumors have sparked curiosity about OpenAI potentially developing new technology called Agent 2.0. This tool is supposed to allow language models greater control over web browsers to automate tasks across the internet without utilizing the API of internet services. The core premise around Agent 2.0 is enabling LLMs to interact with and control browsers more flexibly to automate activities spanning various websites and web apps.</description>

      <description>Prompt Engineering: A Competitive Edge As an employer and a leader who utilizes AI regularly, I have seen firsthand why prompt engineering is becoming a must-have skill.
Hiring for Initiative Candidates skilled at prompting immediately stand out in job interviews nowadays. With AI assistants handling lots of routine tasks, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for self-starters who can maximize productivity from day one. Prompt literacy demonstrates that - rather than needing detailed instructions, these employees take charge to translate goals into crisp prompts that extract the most value from AI.</description>

      <description>Embracing the Future: Why AI Is More Than Just a Hype Short version Quick and Smart Information Access:
AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), delivers fast and accurate search results. Understands user queries better than traditional search engines. Overcoming the Blank Page Syndrome:
AI suggests simple steps to start big tasks, making it easier to begin work. Acts as a helpful nudge against procrastination. Economical for Work:
AI is cost-effective, offering significant time savings for a fraction of the cost.</description>

      <title>Consistency in AI: Challenges and Solutions</title>

      <description>One of the primary challenges confronting current AI models, especially the transformer-based ones, is the ability to ensure consistent results. While it&amp;rsquo;s a recognized fact that these models might produce different outputs for identical datasets, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to differentiate between consistency and determinism. Determinism, in a computational context, means that given the same initial conditions, the algorithm will produce the same results every time. However, inherent randomness during training can introduce variability.</description>

      <description>As times goes by the lines between different business processes have started to blur. One such area where this is increasingly evident is the intersection of business processing systems and marketing.
The Overlap Between Business Processing Systems and Marketing It&amp;rsquo;s quite intuitive to view marketing processes as an extension of general business processes. While there are occasional exceptions, such as viral marketing phenomena, the majority of marketing work hours are spent following a fairly deterministic execution flow.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT, LLMs and Black Boxes</title>
      <link>https://alex-y-su.github.io/posts/chatgpt-gpt3-llm/</link>

      <description>Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can be incredibly helpful tools for generating text quickly and accurately. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that LLMs are not sentient beings and they don&amp;rsquo;t truly understand the meaning behind the language they generate. Instead, they use mathematical models to predict the most likely response based on their training data. To use LLMs effectively, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be mindful of the data that&amp;rsquo;s being used to train them.</description>

      <title>What to Avoid When You Do Job Test</title>
      <link>https://alex-y-su.github.io/posts/what-to-avoid-when-you-do-job-test/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interviewing software developers for 11 years, and for the last four years, I&amp;rsquo;ve averaged 1-2 interviews each week. We normally don&amp;rsquo;t send a test to persons whose experience we can readily validate in an interview or through a background check, but it is OK to send a test to applicants with no or little experience. From start to finish, the test usually takes less than 4 hours to construct.</description>

      <description>The older I become, the less I seek for the most innovative answers. Some solutions should suffice, even if they are far from flawless.
For a website with dynamic material, such as a blog or personal page, generation is not required. Also, it is preferable not to pay wherever possible (there is always a better place to use your money than Amazon or your domestic hosting provider).
HUGO (https://gohugo.io) generates this side statically.</description>
