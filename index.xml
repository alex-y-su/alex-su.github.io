      <description>As times goes by the lines between different business processes have started to blur. One such area where this is increasingly evident is the intersection of business processing systems and marketing.
The Overlap Between Business Processing Systems and Marketing It&amp;rsquo;s quite intuitive to view marketing processes as an extension of general business processes. While there are occasional exceptions, such as viral marketing phenomena, the majority of marketing work hours are spent following a fairly deterministic execution flow.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT, LLMs and Black Boxes</title>

      <description>Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can be incredibly helpful tools for generating text quickly and accurately. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that LLMs are not sentient beings and they don&amp;rsquo;t truly understand the meaning behind the language they generate. Instead, they use mathematical models to predict the most likely response based on their training data. To use LLMs effectively, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be mindful of the data that&amp;rsquo;s being used to train them.</description>

      <title>What to Avoid When You Do Job Test</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interviewing software developers for 11 years, and for the last four years, I&amp;rsquo;ve averaged 1-2 interviews each week. We normally don&amp;rsquo;t send a test to persons whose experience we can readily validate in an interview or through a background check, but it is OK to send a test to applicants with no or little experience. From start to finish, the test usually takes less than 4 hours to construct.</description>

      <title>How This Site Made and Site Generators</title>

      <description>The older I become, the less I seek for the most innovative answers. Some solutions should suffice, even if they are far from flawless.
For a website with dynamic material, such as a blog or personal page, generation is not required. Also, it is preferable not to pay wherever possible (there is always a better place to use your money than Amazon or your domestic hosting provider).
HUGO (https://gohugo.io) generates this side statically.</description>
