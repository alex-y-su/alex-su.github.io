      <description>I interview software engineers past 11 years, and last four years, I have an average 1-2 interview per week. We usually donâ€™t send a test to people with the experience we can easily confirm on an interview or by a background check, but for candidates with no or little experience, it is ok to send a test. Usually, the test takes less than 4 hours of development from start to end.</description>

      <description>The older I become, the less I search for maximum fresh solutions. Some solutions should be just good enough, even if far from perfect.
For web site like a blog or personal page Wordpress or another CMS with dynamic content, generation is just not needed. Also, it is good not to pay when you can (there is always a better place to use your money than Amazon or your domestic hosting provider).</description>
